# Bringing New Life to the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (SM-T510)
## Our Mission

We're a community dedicated to breathing fresh life into the Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (SM-T510) through custom ROM development. Inspired by the pioneering work of Magendanz on LineageOS 18.1 TWRP builds, we aim to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible on this device.

# How You Can Contribute

Development: If you've got coding chops, dive into the codebase, suggest features, and work on optimizations.
Documentation: Help us create clear guides and tutorials to make the ROM accessible to everyone.
Spread the Word: Share our project with other Galaxy Tab A users!
